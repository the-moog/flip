# flip
Fork of flip v1.20 source to add support for compilation under MinGW


*flip* does newline conversions between **IX and MS-DOS conventions.  Uses a state
machine, so repeated conversions on the same file will do no harm.
Assumes the US ASCII character set in some places (search for 'ASCII').
