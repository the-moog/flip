.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBflip\fP is a file interchange program that converts text file
formats between **ix and MS-DOS.  It converts lines ending with
carriage-return (CR) and linefeed (LF) to lines ending with just
linefeed, or vice versa.  If the special argument "-" is given, input
is read from stdin and written to stdout.

\fBflip\fP has the following features:
.sp
.RS
\fBflip\fP will normally refuse to convert binary files.  You
can override this.

When asked to convert a file to the same format that it
already has, \fBflip\fP causes no change to the file.  Thus
to convert all files to **IX format you can type
.sp
.nf
.\"                    flip -u *.*  (under MS-DOS)
                    flip -u *
.\"    (under **IX)
.fi
.sp
and all files will end up right, regardless of whether
they were in MS-DOS or in **IX format to begin with.
This also works in the opposite direction.

If a file contains isolated CR characters for
underlining or overprinting, \fBflip\fP does not change them.

\fBflip\fP preserves file timestamps.  You can override this.

\fBflip\fP preserves file permissions.

\fBflip\fP is written in C and will compile and run under
MS-DOS/Turbo C, 4.3BSD, and System V.

\fBflip\fP accepts wildcards and multiple filenames on the command line.

If a user interrupt aborts \fBflip\fP, it does not leave
behind any garbage files or cause corruption of the
files being converted.

When converting from MS-DOS to **IX format, \fBflip\fP
removes any trailing control Z (the last character in
the file), but leaves embedded control Z characters
unchanged.  This minimizes the possibility of
accidentally converting a binary file that contains a
control Z near the beginning.  You can override this
and ask \fBflip\fP to recognize the first control Z found as
end-of-file.

\fBflip\fP can be asked to strip the high (parity) bit as it
converts a file.
.RE
.sp
\fBflip\fP is normally invoked as:
.nf
               flip -umhvtb file ...
.fi
One of -u, -m, or -h is required.  Switches may be given
separately or combined together after a dash.  For example,
the three command lines given below are equivalent:
.nf
               flip -uvt *.c
               flip -u -v -t *.c
               flip -u -vt *.c
.fi

On systems that allow a program to know its own name, \fBflip\fP
may be renamed (or linked) to a file called toix 
.\" (or toix.exe under MS-DOS) 
for conversion to **IX format, or to a file called toms
.\" (or toms.exe under MS-DOS) 
for conversion to MS-DOS format.  When invoked with the name toix or
toms, \fBflip\fP will act as if it were invoked with the -u or -m
option respectively.
.\" 
.\" .SH RETURN VALUE
.\" On success, \fB@name@\fP returns ...
.\" On error, it returns \-1, and \fIerrno\fP is set appropriately.
.SH OPTIONS

.IP -u
Convert to **IX format (CR LF => LF, lone CR or LF unchanged, trailing
control Z removed, embedded control Z unchanged).
.IP -m
Convert to MS-DOS format (lone LF => CR LF, lone CR unchanged).
.IP -h
Give a help message.
.IP -v
Be verbose, print filenames as they are processed.
.IP -t
Touch files (don't preserve timestamps).
.IP -s
Strip high bit.
.IP -b
Convert binary files too (else binary files are left unchanged).
.IP -z
Truncate file at first control Z encountered.
