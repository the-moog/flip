Installation instructions are provided for System V Release 2, 4.3BSD,
Ultrix, Microport System V/AT, and MS-DOS/Turbo C.  To install under other
similar environments look carefully in flip.h and make changes as needed.


MS-DOS/TURBO C

The files supplied are suitable for compilation with Borland's Turbo C 2.0
for MS-DOS.

A makefile "makefile.tcc" is supplied.  Use the command line compiler
"tcc.exe".  You will need a good make program, such as NDMAKE.  Edit
"turboc.cfg" so it correctly reflects the include directories on your
system.  Then type "make -f makefile.tcc".

You can also use the intergrated environment "tc.exe".  Convert "turboc.cfg"
to "tcconfig.tc" using Borland's "tcconfig.exe" program.  Invoke tc.exe and
load the configuration file "tcconfig.tc".  A project file "flip.prj" is
supplied.  Compile as usual.


SYSTEM V RELEASE 2, 4.3BSD, OR MICROPORT SYSTEM V/AT

Rename the provided file "makefile.nix" to "makefile".

Depending on the system, type:

     make sys_v                 for System V Release 2
     make bsd                   for 4.3BSD
     make uport                 for Microport System V/AT (large model)
     make ultrix                for Ultrix, includes bug fix, not tested

It may work to do "make sys_v" for Microport System V/AT, but I'm not sure,
as I haven't yet restored my small model libraries which vanished from my
disk one day without warning.

Under any flavor of **IX you can link "flip" to "toix" and "toms".
